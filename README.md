## TASK 3 TIC TAC TOE GAME

This repository contains a simple Stopwatch web application project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created as part of my internship at PRODIGY INFOTECH.

## Overview

This web application allows two players to play the classic game of `Tic Tac Toe` on the same system. Players can take turns marking X and O on the game board until there's a winner or a draw.
